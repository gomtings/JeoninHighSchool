sentence=Library for I2C, Serial and SPI Communication with u-blox GNSS modules<br/><br/>
paragraph=An Arduino Library to support the full range of u-blox GNSS modules, using both NMEA and UBX protocols over I2C, Serial and SPI. Useful for interfacing to the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136">SparkFun GPS-RTK2</a> ZED-F9P, <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005">SparkFun GPS-RTK</a> NEO-M8P-2, <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15210">SparkFun SAM-M8Q</a>, <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15193">SparkFun ZOE-M8Q</a> and all the other SparkFun u-blox GNSS Breakouts.<br/><br/>The ZED-F9P and NEO-M8P-2 modules are top-of-the-line modules for high accuracy GNSS and GPS location solutions including RTK. The ZED-F9P is unique in that it is capable of both rover and base station operations allowing the module to become a base station and produce RTCM 3.x correction data.<br/><br/>Need support for RTK NTRIP Caster services like RTK2go, Emlid Caster and Skylark? This library has functions, callbacks and tried-and-tested examples to let you push RTCM correction data to your module seamlessly!<br/>
