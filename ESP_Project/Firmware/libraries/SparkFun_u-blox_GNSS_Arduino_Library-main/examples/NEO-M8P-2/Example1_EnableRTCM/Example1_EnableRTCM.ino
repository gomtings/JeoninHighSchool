  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example sends the command to enable the four RTCM messages needed for RTK. This 
  is the first part of a larger tutorial and example to setup an RTK base station.
  These commands are only accepted by the NEO-M8P module.
 
  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GNSS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
