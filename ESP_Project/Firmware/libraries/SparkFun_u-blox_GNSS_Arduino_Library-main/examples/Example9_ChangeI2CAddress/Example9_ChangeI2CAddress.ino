  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to change the I2C address of a u-blox module

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!

  NEO-M8P RTK: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005
  SAM-M8Q: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15106

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GNSS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
