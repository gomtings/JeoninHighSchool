# SPIFFSIniFile

SPIFFSIniFile is an Arduino library for reading ini files via SPIFFS.
This is just a modification of this library: [IniFile](https://github.com/stevemarple/IniFile)

In case of any questions regarding how this library works, please refer to the previous link.

All credits go to Steven Marple. All I did was adapt the source to work on SPIFFS aiming at providing this feature for ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms.
